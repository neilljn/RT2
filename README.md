# RT2

Contains code used for RT2. The `simualtion.R` file contains code for simulating the SIR model for a fixed population, as used in my RT2 presentation and Section 2 of my RT2 report. The `inference.R` file contains code for performing Bayesian inference on the SIR model given recovery times, as used in Section 4 of my report.
